# Customer Segmentation

This project focuses on customer segmentation using an unsupervised learning approach with the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior, which can help in tailoring marketing strategies and improving customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a crucial strategy in marketing, allowing businesses to target specific groups of customers more effectively. In this project, we have used a given dataset to perform clustering using the K-Means algorithm.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer data including features such as:

- Customer ID
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- ... (add more features as applicable)

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for clustering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand distributions and relationships.
3. **Feature Selection**: Selecting relevant features for clustering.
4. **K-Means Clustering**: Applying the K-Means algorithm to segment customers.
5. **Cluster Evaluation**: Evaluating the clusters using the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) method.
6. **Visualization**: Visualizing the clusters and their characteristics.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/28priya/Customer-Segmentation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Customer-Segmentation
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook Customer_Segmentation.ipynb
    ```
    or
    ```sh
    python customer_segmentation.py
    ```

## Results

- Detailed description of the customer segments.
- Visualizations of the clusters.
- Insights and potential marketing strategies for each segment.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation. The insights gained can help businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
